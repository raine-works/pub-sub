# 🚀 Get Started

## 📦 Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed, or use the included devcontainer to launch a preconfigured development environment. Once everything is set up, run:

```bash
bun install
```

## 🧪 Start Development Servers

Fire up the dev environment with:

```bash 
bun run dev
```

Once the development servers are running, open [http://localhost:8001/test/unique_id](http://localhost:8001/test/unique_id) in your browser.
